## Project Description
SyncroScribe leverages speech-to-text and generative AI models to ease the burden on overworked healthcare professionals. During a nurse's shift with a patient, they can easily record short snippets of information that are transcribed to text. Then, when their shift ends and they hand off their patients to the next nurse, SyncroScribe can transcribe their conversation, extracting the most important and nuanced information to be summarized and referred to later. This technology will help to reduce the loss of vital information between healthcare workers, reducing the likelihood of preventable injuries and deaths.
